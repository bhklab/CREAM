Description: Provides a new method for identification of clusters of genomic
 regions within chromosomes. Primarily, it is used for calling clusters of 
 cis-regulatory elements (COREs). 'CREAM' uses genome-wide maps of genomic regions
 in the tissue or cell type of interest, such as those generated from chromatin-based 
 assays including DNaseI, ATAC or ChIP-Seq. 'CREAM' considers proximity of the elements 
 within chromosomes of a given sample to identify COREs in the following steps:
 1) It identifies window size or the maximum allowed distance between the elements 
 within each CORE, 2) It identifies number of elements which should be clustered 
 as a CORE, 3) It calls COREs, 4) It filters the COREs with lowest order which 
 does not pass the threshold considered in the approach.
