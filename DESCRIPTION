Description: CREAM is a new method for identification of clusters of
 functional regions (COREs) within chromosomes. It uses genome-wide maps of
 functional regions in the tissue or cell type of interest, 
 such as those generated from chromatin-based assays including DNaseI, ATAC or ChIP-Seq.
 CREAM considers proximity of the elements within chromosomes of a given sample to identify
 COREs in the following steps:1) It identifies window size or the maximum allowed distance
 between the elements within each CORE, 2) It identifies number of elements which should be
 clustered as a CORE, 3) It calls COREs, 4) It filters the COREs with lowest order which 
 does not pass the threshold considered in the appraoch.
